            <h2> Week 1-2</h2>
            
                <p>For the First lesson I first started off by taking a look at the last time I took JAPN 102. This way I could get a better Idea of some of the material and verbs that were covered. I then began to play around with verbs and modified it by using suffixes. I logged into my old blackboard account to find verbs and suffixes that where covered.</p>

For todays practice/activity I decided to use JLL to once again start creating sentence’s in English and than trying to convert them to Japanese by memory and afterwards comparing my result to the results of J.L.L Not-to-be.

The box I purchased was a kids book that focusus and old Japaese tails. I began translating the book by hand slowly breaking down phrases to see if I could identify any. If I couldn't figure out the sentence I would then use J.L.L to help Idenify the phrase. I slowly unreavled the storey of </p>
            
            <h2>Week 7-8</h2>
            <p> I decied to do a side project to better understand what i have prevouissly learned. I am enrolled into a late start computer class. The class focuses on simple webiste buolding. The teacher would like a website that has a perpose so I decided to create a website with the idea that it can help someone learning atleast something new regardifn the Japanese Language. Building the website I first thought what would be a good starting point. If this website would be  </p>
